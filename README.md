# Controllable Single-Shot Animation Blending with Temporal Conditioning
This repository provides the code for the first single-shot motion blending framework, built on a batched implementation of the GANimator model, that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning the generation process. It is based on [GANimateer](https://github.com/moverseai/ganimateer), an AI-based post-processing toolset for automating the character animation process.
